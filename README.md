# Bring up firefly-fabconnect

This documentation shows several ways to deploy firefly-fabconnect:
- Using `fabconnect` and the [Fabric `test-network`](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/main/test-network) in the samples repository.
  > This mode runs an instance of fabconnect using a docker container managed by docker-compose.
- Using `fabconnect` and the [Fabric `test-network-nano-bash`](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/main/test-network-nano-bash) in the samples repository.
  > This mode runs an instance of fabconnect compiled from source code.

- Using `FireFly CLI`

  > `FireFly CLI` mode runs some supernodes on your machine. The stack contains an instance of firefly-core, firefly-dataexchange-https, ipfs, and firefly-sandbox.

## Using fabconnect and the Fabric `test-network` <a name="fabconnect_testnetwork"></a>
This mode runs an instance of fabconnect using a docker container managed by docker-compose.
> **NOTE**: This mode has only been tested on Ubuntu 20.04.

### Download fabric-samples, docker images, and fabric binaries<a name="fabconnect_testnetwork_download_prerequisites"></a>

```bash
cd $HOME
```
To get the install script:

```bash
curl -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/fabric/main/scripts/install-fabric.sh && chmod +x install-fabric.sh
```

Run the script:
```bash
./install-fabric.sh -f 2.4.4 d b s
```
> **NOTE**: These arguments download the `Fabric Images` 2.4.4 version, clone the `fabric-samples` repository, and download the `Fabric binaries`.

[Visit this link for better instructions...](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)

### Bring up `"test-network"`<a name="fabconnect_testnetwork_bringup_testnetwork"></a>

```bash
cd fabric-samples/test-network
```
Run the following command to start the network, create a channel with  `mychannel` default name, and generate the cryptographic artifacts with the Fabric CA:

```bash
./network.sh up createChannel -ca -c mychannel
```

### Download configuration<a name="fabconnect_testnetwork_download_fabconnect"></a>

Download this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kmilodenisglez/fabconnect-testnet.git
```
> **NOTE**: This repository has a docker-compose file that starts a firefly-fabconnect container. It is configured to mount the cryptographic artifacts volume from `$HOME/fabric-samples/test-network/organizations/`.

```bash
cd fabconnect
```
### Bring up `fabconect`<a name="fabconnect_testnetwork_bringup_fabconnect"></a>

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Using fabconnect and the Fabric `test-network-nano-bash` <a name="fabconnect_testnetworknanobash"></a>
In this mode, an instance of fabconnect that we built from the source code is used.

> **NOTE**: This mode has been tested on `Ubuntu` and on `Windows 10 with WSL`. The network was bring up with the minimum configuration, with two orderer nodes (**./orderer1.sh** and **./orderer2.sh**) and a single Org1 peer node (**./peer1.sh**).

### Bring up `"test-network-nano-bash"`<a name="fabconnect_testnetwork_bringup_testnetworknanobash"></a>

üëâüèæ [Follow the instructions to bring up network and install the chaincode.](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/main/test-network-nano-bash#test-network---nano-bash)

### Download and build __fabconnect__<a name="download_fabconnect_build"></a>

```bash
cd $HOME
```

Download the fabconnect repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-fabconnect.git
```

### Compile __fabconnect__
```bash
go mod vendor
go build -o fabconnect
```

### Move fabconnect binary to /usr/bin/local
```bash
 chmod +x fabconnect && sudo cp fabconnect /usr/local/bin/
```

```bash
cd $HOME
```

### Download configuration<a name="fabconnect_testnetwork_download_fabconnect2"></a>

Download this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kmilodenisglez/fabconnect-testnet.git
```

### Modify the cpp and fabconnect files for __test-network-nano-bash__ <a name="fabconnect_testnetwork_modify_cpp"></a>

Modify in the test-network-nano-bash CCP file named `cpp_nanobash.yaml` the path to the artifacts. Wherever you find `'/home/my_user/fabric-samples'` you replace it with the path to your `fabric-samples`.

Modify in the `fabconnect-testnet/runtime/blockchain/fabconnect_nanobash.yaml` file the paths. Wherever you find `'/home/my_user/fabconnect-testnet'` you replace it with the path to your `fabconnect-testnet`.


###  Launch the connector <a name="fabconnect_testnetwork_launch_connector"></a>
Before starting the fabconnect we must configure the identity (signer) that will be used to establish a connection with the blockchain network. The `test-network-nano-bash` does not bring up Fabric-CA nodes, so you have to use the `admin` identity generated by the `generate_artifacts.sh` script.

We open in a file explorer the path where the credentials are stored. The path is defined in the CCP file `"cpp_nanobash.yaml"`, in the `client.credentialStore` section.

For this example the `fabric-samples/test-network-nano-bash` is in the home directory.

```bash
cd ~/fabric-samples/test-network-nano-bash/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/
```

We copy the `Admin@org1.example.com-cert.pem` to the root directory of `/users` with the following format `user + @ + MSPID + "-cert.pem"`:

```bash
cp Admin@org1.example.com/msp/signcerts/Admin@org1.example.com-cert.pem ./admin@Org1MSP-cert.pem
```
> **NOTE**: It is the format used by fabric-sdk-go to store a user.

Copy the `priv_sk` private key to the `/users/keystore/` directory:
```bash
cp Admin@org1.example.com/msp/keystore/priv_sk ./keystore/
```

Use the following command to launch the connector:
```bash
./fabconnect -f "/home/my_user/fabconnect-testnet/runtime/blockchain/fabconnect_nanobash.yaml"
```

## Using firefly-cli<a name="fireflycli"></a>

### Download and installation the __CLI__<a name="download_installation"></a>
Follow the steps from the official README for [download](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-cli/#download-the-package-for-your-os) and [install](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-cli/#extract-the-binary-and-move-it-to-usrbinlocal) from the cli.

### Create a stack of __Hyperledger Fabric__<a name="stack_fabric"></a>
The `ff init` command creates a new stack and will prompt you for a few details, such as the members number (organizations), the organization(s) name and peer nodes name.
```bash
ff init -b fabric --prompt-names stack-fabric
```
Once the execution of the command has finished, you should see an output similar to this:

```
initializing new FireFly stack...
number of members: 1
name for org 0: org1
name for node 0: peer1
Stack 'stack-fabric' created!
To start your new stack run:

  ff start stack-fabric
```
> **NOTE**: In this example the stack `stack-fabric` was created with a single member named `"org1"` and a node named `"peer1"`.

### Configuration files<a name="config_files"></a>

> **NOTE**: The configuration files for each stack are located in `~/.firefly/stacks/`

## Interacting with the `asset-transfer-basic` chaincode<a name="fabconnect_testnetwork_interacting_cc"></a>

### In `fabconnect` mode with Fabric's `test-network` or `test-network-nano-bash`<a name="fabconnect_testnetwork_interacting_cc_mode1"></a>

- If you operate with the `test-network` you can install the `asset-transfer-basic` chaincode with the steps: [Install the asset-transfer-basic on test-network](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_network.html#starting-a-chaincode-on-the-channel)

- If you operate with `test-network-nano-bash` you can install the `asset-transfer-basic` chaincode with the steps: [Install the asset-transfer-basic on test-network-nano-bash](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/main/test-network-nano-bash#instructions-for-deploying-and-running-the-basic-asset-transfer-sample-chaincode)

> **NOTE**: To interact with the fabconnect endpoints you can access the link http://__ip_address__:3000/api in your browser.

### InitLedger
Invoke the POST /transactions endpoint, with the following data:
```json
{
  "headers": {
    "type": "SendTransaction",
    "signer": "admin",
    "channel": "mychannel",
    "chaincode": "basic"
  },
  "func": "InitLedger",
  "args": [],
  "init": false
}
```
As a result, the client should respond with a JSON similar to this:
```json
{
  "headers": {
    "id": "cee5a0b8-e207-49c9-76a2-ca0d106fa139",
    "type": "TransactionSuccess",
    "timeReceived": "2022-07-18T06:00:37.323214822Z",
    "timeElapsed": 2.217562622,
    "requestOffset": "",
    "requestId": ""
  },
  "blockNumber": 6,
  "signerMSP": "Org1MSP",
  "signer": "admin",
  "transactionID": "44574737473df89f0183827f10ede4b5e99563ba44df6b7d48a49763d9179228",
  "status": "VALID"
}
```

### QueryAllAssets
Invokes the POST /query endpoint, with the following data:
```json
{
  "headers": {
    "signer": "admin",

    "chaincode": "basic"
  },
  "func": "GetAllAssets",
  "args": [
    "string"
  ],
  "strongread": true
}
```
As a result, the client should respond with a JSON similar to this:
```json
{
  "headers": {
    "channel": "mychannel",
    "timeReceived": "",
    "timeElapsed": 0,
    "requestOffset": "",
    "requestId": ""
  },
  "result": [
    {
      "AppraisedValue": 300,
      "Color": "blue",
      "ID": "asset1",

      "Color": "red",
      "ID": "asset2",
      "Owner": "Brad",
      "Size": 5
    },
    ...
  ]
}
 ```
### In `firefly-cli` mode <a name="fabconnect_testnetwork_interacting_cc_mode2"></a>
If you use `firefly-cli` you can install and interact with the `asset-transfer-basic` chaincode by following the steps: [Working asset-transfer-basic with firefly-cli](https://hyperledger.github.io/firefly/tutorials/custom_contracts/fabric.html#work-with-hyperledger-fabric-chaincodes)

## Documentation <a name="doc"></a>

- [FireFly Fabconnect - Github](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-fabconnect)
- [FireFly Cli - Github](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-cli/)
- [Firefly - Doc](https://hyperledger.github.io/firefly/)

## Troubleshooting <a name="troubleshooting"></a>
If fabconnect returned any `TRANSIENT_FAILURE` errors, one possible reason is that you need to add the domain names "peer0.org1.example.com", "orderer.example.com", and "org1.example.com" to the hosts ".

Run the following:
```bash
echo '127.0.0.1 peer0.org1.example.com orderer.example.com org1.example.com' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```
